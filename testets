The 4PLs send the WhatsApp request to U-445 ALG Application Layer Gateway asynchronously. ALG Application sends request to Load Balancer. The load balancer will then forward the request to CCT. Similarly, in CCT, WhatsApp Hub will send the response by invoking the 4PLs API back to 4PLs in asynchronous way.
The WhatsApp HUB will send the request to U-445 ALG Application Layer Gateway Address asynchronously. Then ALG sends request to 4th platform.  

    
    Requested Change
The 4PLS is moving from unmanaged system to a managed system. Hence ALG is being replaced with API Gateway.
There is a need of Migration from ALG to API Gateway to basically migrate customers to managed accounts.
In the new architecture the 4PLs will send the WhatsApp request to API Gateway asynchronously. API Gateway  sends request to Load Balancer. The load balancer will then forward the request to CCT. Similarly, in CCT, WhatsApp Hub will send the response to API Gateway and from API Gateway the response will be sent to the 4PLs platform.

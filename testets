ecurity scopes for the Webform Email API will be defined in the Swagger file to regulate application access to the API, allowing or denying requests. The Swagger file will undergo updates to include security schemes related to scopes. Consumers will configure the same scope, “u-440:webForm:c,” to access the API, as illustrated in Figure 2. This new scope is added to the Swagger file under “security:default: scopes” section.

Once the Swagger file is published in the API Gateway, any incoming Webform request will first have its scope checked in the API Gateway to verify if it contains “u-440:webForm:c.” If the request includes this scope, it will proceed to reach GMS.
